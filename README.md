- To set up .env. files correctly you need to create 2 of them first:
  First one is called ".env.development" and second one is called ".env.test"
  Add following data to the first file - "PGDATABASE = nc_news" - it will make sure you are connected to the development database.
  Add following data for the second file - "PGDATABASE = nc_news_test" - it will make sure you are connected to the test database.
